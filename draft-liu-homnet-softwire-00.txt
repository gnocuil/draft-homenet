                 Building Softwire in IPv6 Home Network
                     draft-liu-homenet-softwire-00

Abstract

   In IPv6 home network, IPv4 service may still be needed for a long
   time.  ISP can provider IPv4 service through IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire
   mechanisms, e.g.  Dual-Stack Lite ([RFC6333]).  This document
   discusses how to build softwires from home routers, especially when
   there are multiple routers those are running distributed
   configuration and routing protocols.

1.  Introduction

   In IPv6 home network environments, when there are multiple routers,
   the routers are running distributed configuration and routing
   protocols.  HNCP ([I-D.stenberg-homenet-hncp]) is designed to
   configure home routers with IP prefixes and other information
   including stateless DHCPv6 options provided by ISPs.  OSPFv3
   ([RFC5340]) is used for IPv6 routing

   As the IPv6 transition takes a long time and large cost, the demand
   of IPv4 service may still last for a long time and the ISP still
   needs to provide IPv4 service.  To deal with the shortage of IPv4
   addresses, several IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms are proposed,
   e.g.  Dual-Stack Lite ([RFC6333]), MAP ([I-D.ietf-softwire-map]), and
   Lightweight 4over6 ([I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6]).  The three
   mechanisms are similar in many aspects: provisioning specific
   information by DHCPv6, and IPv4 packets are transported in IPv4-in-
   IPv6 tunnels.

   When ISP provides dual stack link to the homenet Edge Router, the
   Edge Router gets IPv4 address and performs NAT.  The other home
   routers pick private IPv4 prefixes through HNCP, and the homenet runs
   OSPFv2 ([RFC2328]) to configure IPv4 routing.  When ISP provides
   IPv6-only link and softwire service instead of dual stack, the same
   way - private IPv4 prefix + NAT and build softwire on Edge Router -
   still works.  However, running OSPFv2 adds additional cost to the
   homenet.  To remove OSPFv2, building softwire from all home routers

   is an alternative solution.  And it's even possible to build softwire
   from end hosts.

   This document discusses how homenet can build softwires in these
   methods, and discusses the compatibility with DS-Lite, MAP and
   Lightweight 4over6.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   The document defines the following terms:

   Edge Router:   A home router that connects to ISP network.  ISP can
                  provision stateless DHCPv6 parameters to Edge Routers.

   End Router:    A home router that directly connects to end hosts.

4.  Softwire Initiated by Inner Home Router

   In this section we discuss how to build IPv4-over-IPv6 Softwire from
   every inner home router that connects to end hosts directly, which we
   call "End Routers".  If a Edge Router that connects to ISP network
   also connects to some end hosts, it's also treated as a End Router.

   To build softwire by End Routers, each router must get the
   information of the softwire, including the IPv6 address of remote
   tunnel endpoint, and other solution-specific information.  All DS-
   Lite, MAP and Lightweight 4over6 use DHCPv6 option to provision
   softwire information.  When the Edge Router receives a DHCPv6
   response, it advertises the softwire information in DHCPv6 options to
   all routers through HNCP.  When a inner home router receives the
   softwire information, it initiates an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  In some
   solutions (e.g.  Lightweight 4over6), the router needs to get more
   information before it builds the tunnel.

   It's possible that the home net connects to multiple ISPs, and each
   ISP provides its own IPv6 prefix and softwire configuration to the
   same or different Edge Routers.  In this case, the Edge Router(s)
   advertise each Softwire configuration to the homenet independently,
   and each Softwire configuration must be bound to the IPv6 prefix from
   the same ISP.  The home routers set up their Softwires accordingly,
   and for each tunnel, the tunnel outer IPv6 addresses and inner IPv4
   addresses must come the same ISP.

4.1.  Running DS-Lite

   In DS-Lite, all routers gets the AFTR-Name option ([RFC6334]) through
   HNCP.  Each router chooses a private IPv4 prefix for its end users,
   and does not need to advertise the prefix to other routers.  The
   routers build IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel according to the AFTR-Name option,
   and routes all IPv4 traffic into the tunnel.  The home routes do not
   perform NAT44.

4.2.  Running MAP

   In MAP-E, the ISP provides Softwire46 MAP-E Container Option
   ([I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp]) to the Edge Router.  Then the whole
   container option is advertised through HNCP.  Each router build MAP
   tunnel according to the option and its Assigned Prefix.  The Assigned
   Prefix is treated as End-user prefix, thus the Delegated Prefix from
   ISP needs to be shorter than the expected End-user prefix, e.g.
   equals to Rule IPv6 prefix.  The Edge Router calculates its public
   IPv4 address (and PSID) according to the MAP algorithm.  Then the
   router performs NAT44, and routes all IPv4 traffic into the tunnel.
   Since all routers in the homenet shares a single MAP rule, the
   routers form (possibly part of) a single MAP domain.  The ISP must
   provide enough IPv4 addresses for the homenet.

4.3.  Running Lightweight 4over6

   In Lightweight 4over6, the S46 IPv4/IPv6 Address Binding
   Option([I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp]) inside the container option only
   contains IPv4 address for a single user.  Thus it can not be used for
   configuring all home routers.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 should be used for
   IPv4 provisioning.  The S46 BR Option([I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp])
   and 4o6 Server Address Option([I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6]) are
   received by Edge Router and advertised through HNCP.  After obtained
   the two options, each router initiates DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 queries to
   get its IPv4 address, and perform NAT44 on the obtained address.

5.  Softwire Initiated by Edge Router

   IPv4-over-IPv6 Softwire can be initiated by Edge Router directly.
   ISPs provide their Softwire configuration information to the Edge
   Routers, and the Edge Routers build their Softwires directly.  After
   setting up the Softwire successfully, a Edge Router chooses a private
   IPv4 prefix and advertise it to the homenet.  Edge Routers running
   DS-Lite do not perform NAT44, and Edge Routers running MAP and
   Lightweight 4over6 perform NAT44.  Private IPv4 prefix configuration
   is through HNCP, and OSPFv2 is used for routing.

6.  Softwire Initiated by End Host

   Softwire can also be initiated by end hosts.  In this case, the Edge
   Routers advertise the Softwire Configuration information to the
   homenet as described in Section 3, but the routers do not set up
   Softwires.  The routers need to configure their LAN side local
   provisioning protocol (e.g.  DHCPv6) to provision the Softwire
   information to end hosts, and end hosts set up the tunnels
   accordingly.

   End host needs to support the Softwire mechanisms.  Since there could
   be various types of end hosts, including PCs, tablets or phones, and
   devices may run different OSs, it may not be easy to do this.

7.  Discussion

   In this draft we have discussed three possible scenarios to build
   IPv4-over-IPv6 Softwire in Homenet.  The purpose of building softwire
   is to provide legacy IPv4 support for home users, and make it easier
   to transit the network to IPv6 and possible to shutdown IPv4.

   Building Softwire from Edge Router is a native way that is quite
   close to dual-stack scenario.  However, it requires IPv4 routing
   inside the home network, and requires IPv4 routing protocol.  Once
   IPv4 routing is deployed in the home network, it's difficult to shut
   it down that even only few end devices require IPv4 service, all home
   routers need to run IPv4 routing protocol.  It's solved by building
   softwire from End Routers that IPv4 routing protocol is not required
   in this case.  Since IPv6 tunnel is built from end routers, there's
   no IPv4 traffic in the homenet and it could help the monitoring and
   network management.  IPv4 service can be shut down at each routers,
   and it will not affect others routers.

   Building Softwire form end hosts is possible, but not easy for large
   scale deployment because user devices are out of ISP's control.  In
   most current home networks, there's already boxes from ISP or third-
   party.  Dealing with routers is much easier for ISP to deploy their
   network.

   According to the discussions, this draft recommends IPv6 home network
   to building IPv4-over-IPv6 Softwire from every End Routers, to
   support IPv4 service.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define a new homenet or softwire mechanism.
   All the three scenarios are the combination of current mechanisms:
   HNCP, OSPF, and Softwire mechanisms: DS-Lite, MAP, and Lightweight
